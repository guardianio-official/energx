                <h2>Unlock the Value of Sustainability: Environmental Credit Trading</h2>
                <img src="https://placehold.co/600x300?text=Environmental+Credit+Types" alt="Environmental Credit Types" class="feature-image">
                <p>Trade environmental credits associated with your green hydrogen, including Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), Guarantees of Origin (GOs), and potentially other low-carbon fuel credits. Our platform ensures these credits are verifiable and securely transferable.</p>

                <h3>Types of Credits Supported (Examples):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) / Guarantees of Origin (GOs):</strong> Prove the renewable origin of the energy used in hydrogen production.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) Credits (Future Scope):</strong> Generate and trade credits in jurisdictions with LCFS programs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Verified GHG Reductions / Carbon Credits (Future Scope):</strong> Quantify and monetize the carbon emissions avoided or removed through green hydrogen production and use.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Benefits:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>For Hydrogen Producers:</strong> Maximize revenue by selling bundled or unbundled environmental attributes.</li>
                    <li><strong>For Credit Buyers:</strong> Meet sustainability goals, compliance obligations, or voluntary environmental commitments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Traceability:</strong> Ensure clear linkage between credits and the underlying hydrogen production.</li>
                    <li><strong>Market Access:</strong> Access a dedicated marketplace for these valuable assets.</li>
                </ul>
